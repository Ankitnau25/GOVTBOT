The provident fund monies are to provide for a source of income (social security) after retirement during old age. To create a sizable savings it is necessary to start saving early and accumulate the corpus by reducing intermittent withdrawals. Hence it is advisable to transfer PF with each job change to reap full benefits of the social security schemes.

 1. PF transfer lets the past service transferred into the current member ID. If the total service is more than 5 years then TDS is not charged on PF withdrawal. Clubbing of past service may help the member in crossing  the 5 year mark thus saving on TDS.
 2. Transferring PF amount instead of withdrawing gives the member the benefit of compounding of funds. The compounding effect can be visualized in a way that if a member does not withdraw his PF money on change of job and gets it transferred to his new account then the same money would get doubled in approximately 8 years, assuming EPFO continues to give at least 8.5% interest rate just like it has given in the past so many years.
 3. A service of more than 10 years makes the member eligible for pensionary benefits. Transfer of PF accounts ensures that the past services does not get lapsed and continues to get added in the subsequent employment.

Hence, the member does not suffer any financial loss in case there is any delay in updating interest in his passbook. Further, if a member withdraws his EPF dues before the interest is updated in his passbook, in that case also at the time of his claim settlement, the due interest is calculated and paid from the date it becomes due automatically by the system. Hence, there is no financial loss to a member in the mentioned later case also. 														"
