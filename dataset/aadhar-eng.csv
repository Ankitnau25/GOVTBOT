25,What are the features and benefits of Aadhaar?,"One Aadhaar: Aadhaar is a unique number, and no resident can have a duplicate number since it is linked to their individual biometrics; thereby identifying fake and ghost identities which result in leakages today. Savings from eliminating duplicates and fakes through Aadhaar-based identification will further enable governments to expand benefits to other eligible residents.Portability: Aadhaar is a universal number, and agencies and services can contact the central Unique Identification database from anywhere in the country to authenticate a beneficiary's identity by availing authentication services.Electronic benefit transfers: The UID-enabled-Bank-Account network will offer a secure and low cost platform to directly remit benefits to residents without the heavy costs associated today with benefit distribution; the leakages in the current system will also be stemmed as a result.Aadhaar-based authentication to confirm entitlement delivered to the beneficiary: The UIDAI will offer online authentication services for agencies who wish to validate a resident's identity; this service will enable confirmation of the entitlement actually reaching the intended beneficiary. Improved services through increased transparency: Clear accountability and transparent monitoring would significantly improve access and quality of entitlements to beneficiaries and the agency alike. Self-service puts residents in control: Using Aadhaar as an authentication mechanism, residents should be able to access up-to-date information about their entitlements, demand services and redress their grievances directly from their mobile phone, kiosks or other means. In the case of self-service on the resident's mobile, security is assured using two-factor authentication (i.e. by proving possession of the resident's registered Mobile Number and knowledge of the resident's Aadhaar PIN). These standards are compliant with the Reserve Bank of India's approved standards for Mobile Banking and Payments."

27,How does the UIDAI protect the individual and their information?,"Protection of the individual, and the safeguarding their information is inherent in the design of the UID project. From having a random number which does not reveal anything about the individual to other features listed below, the UID project keeps the interest of the resident at the core of its purpose and objectives. Collecting limited information: Data collected by the UIDAI is purely to issue Aadhaar, and confirm the identity of Aadhaar holders. The UIDAI is collecting basic data fields in order to be able to establish identity this includes Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, Parent/ Guardian's name essential for children but not for others, mobile number and email id is optional as well . The UIDAI is collecting biometric information to establish uniqueness therefore collecting photo, 10 finger prints and iris. No profiling and tracking information collected: The UIDAI policy bars it from collecting sensitive personal information such as religion, caste, community, class, ethnicity, income and health. The profiling of individuals is therefore not possible through the UID system, since the data collected is limited to that required for identification and identity confirmation. The UIDAI had in fact, dropped the place of birth data field part of the initial list of information it planned to collect based on feedback from CSOs that it could lead to profiling. The UIDAI also does not collect any transaction records of the individual. The records of an individual confirming their identity through Aadhaar will only reflect that such a confirmation happened. This limited information will be retained for a short period time in the interest of the resident, to resolve any disputes. Release of information - yes or no response: The UIDAI is barred from revealing personal information in Aadhaar database the only response permitted is yes or no to requests to verify an identity The only exceptions are the order of a High court , or the order of a secretary, in case of national security . This is a reasonable exception and is clear and precise. This approach is also in line with security norms followed in US and Europe on access to data in case of a security threat. Data protection and privacy: The UIDAI has the obligation to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data collected . The data will be collected on software provided by the UIDAI and encrypted to prevent leaks in transit. Trained and certified enrollers will collect the information, who will not have access to the data being collected. The UIDAI has a comprehensive security policy to ensure the safety and integrity of its data. It will publish more details on this, including the Information Security Plan and Policies for the CIDR and mechanisms for auditing the compliance of the UIDAI and its contracting agencies. In addition, there will be strict security and storage protocols in place. Penalties for any security violation will be severe, and include penalties for disclosing identity information . There are penal consequences for unauthorised access to CIDR including hacking , and penalties for tampering with data in the CIDR under the Aadhaar Act, 2016 . Convergence and linking of UIDAI information to other databases: The UID database is not linked to any other databases, or to information held in other databases. Its only purpose will be to verify a person's identity at the point of receiving a service, and that too with the consent of Aadhaar holder. The UID database will be guarded both physically and electronically by a few select individuals with high clearance. It will not be available even for many members of the UID staff and will be secured with the best encryption, and in a highly secure data vault. All access details will be properly logged."
28,What use can Aadhaar be put to?,"Aadhaar can be used to identity beneficiaries for delivery of financial and other subsidies, benefits and services offered by the scheme implementing agencies.

Do not mark biometric exceptions where biometrics can be captured. It will be treated as ‘fraud’ and invite strictest penalty.In case of Biometric exception, always take the Exception photograph of the applicant showing resident’s face and both hands, irrespective of the type of exception.The enrolee may not be in a position to keep herself / himself in correct posture for reaching biometric instruments or for photograph due to old age or sickness. In such cases the operator should arrange to take the biometric data by moving the equipment close to the enrole.If the finger/iris of the applicant has a temporary damage and it is not possible to capture the biometric, the applicant should come later once temporary damage is resolved.Capture Biometrics - Facial Image, IRIS and Fingerprints for all the applicants above 5 years in age.In case of children who are below 5 years in age, only Facial Image and authentication by one of the parent’s/legal guardian is to be captured.
Guidelines for Facial Image Capture
Enrolee Position: For capturing facial image, it is advisable for the operator to adjust the camera instead of the Enrole to position herself/himself at the right distance or in the right posture. Frontal pose needs to be captured i.e. no head rotation or tilt. The applicant should be instructed to be seated properly with their back upright and their face towards the camera.Focus: The capture device should use auto focus and auto-capture functions. The output image should not suffer from motion blur, over or under exposure, unnatural colored lighting, and distortion.Expression: Expression strongly affects the performance of automatic face recognition and also affects accurate visual inspection by humans. It is strongly recommended that the face should be captured with neutral (non-smiling) expression, teeth closed, and both eyes open and looking into the camera.Illumination: Poor illumination has a high impact on the performance of face recognition. Proper and equally distributed lighting mechanism should be used such that there are no shadows over the face, no shadows in eye sockets, and no hot spots. No light exactly above the enrolee should be used since it can cause shadows. Light should be diffused and placed in front of the enrolee so that there are no shadows under the eye.Eye Glasses: glasses should be taken off before taking the photograph.Accessories: Use of accessories that cover any region of the face is not permitted. For example, women in purdah would have to reveal the full face before the photograph is taken. Similarly women in Ghoonghat would have to clearly reveal the full face before the photograph can be captured. The head may remain covered but the full face contour should be visible.Further, accessories like turban/head gear are also allowed as religious/ traditional practices.However, accessories like eye patches are allowed due to medical reasons. This would also mean an exception needs to be recorded for Iris, because only one Iris can be captured.Operators need to be trained to obtain the best possible face images that satisfy requirements. Even if the quality flag is green but the Operator is able to judge that a better picture can be taken, then same should be attempted. However, it should be borne in mind that recapture should not become harassment for the applicant.For children, it is acceptable that the child sits on parent’s laps, but it needs to be ensured that parent’s face is not captured along with child’s face. The background may get rejected due to non white screen in case of children but two faces should not get captured in one picture.Actionable feedback needs to be checked for captures that fail. Some of the actionable feedbacks in software are:No face FoundEnrolee too farEnrolee too close (eye distance in input image is greater than one third of image width)Pose (Look Straight)Insufficient lightingVery low face confidence (faceless, object not identified as human face)Non-uniform lighting (of face in output image)Incorrect background (in output image)Insufficient lighting (bad gray values in face area of output image)If any biometric exceptions have been specified on the demographic screen, these should be captured as photographs on the Photograph screen.Only facial image is captured for children below 5 years. Iris and fingerprint screens will not get activated for children below 5 years
Guidelines for Capturing Fingerprints
The images of all the ten fingers are to be captured. The fingerprints must be captured in the sequence of slaps of four fingers of left hand, right hand followed by the two thumbs.The fingers have to be positioned correctly on the platen to enable capture. There should be no direct light shining on the platen. Use the Indicators on fingerprint devices for positioning of fingers. The fingers should be placed in right direction on the device. Please consult the manufacturer manual incase of any doubt or else consult the supervisor.Use a lint free cloth periodically to clean the platen of the finger print device for good finger print captureCheck devices periodically for scratches, out of focus images, only partial images getting captured. In case any such problem is noticed, then report to your Supervisor/EA and request for change of equipment.Fingerprints cut off, wet/smudged fingerprint; very light prints due to insufficient pressure will result in poor quality. The applicant's hands should be clean (no mud, oil etc.). Ask applicant to wash hands with water and soap, if necessary.The fingers should not be excessively dry or wet. Moisten with a wet cloth or dry finger with a dry clothThe Enrollee should be requested to place all four fingers of the left hand/right hand/two thumbs to platen of the fingerprint scanner for the four-finger capture to ensure good contact and maximize the area of the captured fingerprints. Ensure that the fingers are placed flat and till the top joint of the finger is placed well on the scanner. The top of the fingers should be within the platen area and not outside the defined area.If automatic capture does not happen, the operator should force the capture when force capture tab is enabled in the enrolment software.The operator should check the actionable feedback when capture fails. Some actionable feedbacks provided by software are:Number of fingers present does not match with expected number of fingersFinger not positioned correctlyToo much Pressure (duty cycle)Too little pressureCentral region missingExcessive moisture (wetness)Excessive drynessThe operator should visually check the image for quality and for typical problems. In case there are problems go back to steps above to retry the capture.When image quality is pass or if maximum number of captures are exhausted, move on to the next stepFingerprints are best captured in standing positionIn case of additional fingers, ignore the additional finger and capture the main five fingers.Make sure your own fingerprints do not get mixed with the applicant's fingerprints. Operators can carefully put small pressure on the applicant's fingers to capture the fingerprints but always make sure not to mix your own fingerprints.
Guidelines for Capturing Iris
The operator and not the Enrollee will handle the capture device, generally.Children can be told that it is like taking photos/pictures so that they are not apprehensive.The Enrollee will be required to sit in a fixed position, like taking a portrait photograph.The software is able to measure the iris image quality. An initial image quality assessment would be done to provide feedback to the operator during the capture process. The software alerts the operator with actionable feedbacks, if the captured iris image is of insufficient quality. Some actionable feedbacks provided by software are:Occlusion(significant part of iris is not visible)Iris not in focusGaze incorrect(resident looking away)Pupil dilationThe iris capture process is sensitive to ambient light. No direct or artificial light should directly reflect off Enrolee’s eyes.The device should be held steady. In case device requires to be held by resident, the enrolment operator/supervisor may help the applicant to hold the device steady.Table light used for facial image capture should be switched off during iris capture. Direct sunlight or any other bright light shining on applicant's eye will create reflections and result in poor quality image.Operator must instruct the applicant to look straight into the iris scanner, open eyes wide open (one easy way to do this is to ask the applicant look angry or stare) and do not blink during iris capture. Applicant has to be stationary.If applicant is experiencing difficulty during Iris scan and recapture is required, then the operator may navigate to next screen to capture other details and then return to Iris capture. This will relax the applicant from constant pressure to keep eyes wide open during iris capture.The Operator needs to be patient during capture and wait for the device response instead of scrolling, navigating back and forth on screen."

Further, it is possible to configure the Windows language input to assume a local language keyboard. This is not the same as transliteration, but assumes a different keyboard is being used – and the results are very different. UIDAI have also had difficulty in truly transliterating English words into local language, as they are very different from the language model. This can be better handled by using advanced facilities in the IMEs (for ex. Schemes in Google IME) The language support must be configured on a per user basis, and that makes it harder to manage."
125,How do I import pre-enrolment data in local language?,"At this time, the support has been provided for import of pre-enrolment data in English. During enrolment process, the data is converted from English to local language through the transliteration engine. The operator can correct this data in the presence of the resident. The software is planned to provide support for import of pre-enrolment data in English, local language or both in future versions. For pre-enrolment data imported in local language, it will not be over-ridden by the transliteration engine. However, a soft keypad / IME will be available for editing the data."
